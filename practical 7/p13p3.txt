a) When printed we get "None" at the end.
None is the "default" return value of the print_max function as the function returns "anything".

b) Basically nothing happens, cause it is not executed.
The reason you can call it without paratheses, is such that you can pass the function around

c) Nothing happens. print_max returns a reference to the function, and then
we invoke it with print, so nothing happens.
